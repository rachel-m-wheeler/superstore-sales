## Project Summary

A hypothetical superstore has a sales data set with three years of sales transaction. I created a Tableau dashboard that would enable superstore management to compare sales across regions and determine which segment, product sub-category, and specific products are most profitable.

## Process
<b>Data Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting">Superstore Sales Dataset</a> (Kaggle)<br>
 <br>
<b>Data Cleanup & Preparation:</b><br>
	• I converted the dates in the <em>Order Date</em> and <em>Ship Date</em> column from UK format (DD/MM/YYYY) to US format (MM/DD/YYYY) using the Text-to-Columns feature in Excel.<br>
• I converted the <em>Postal Code</em> column data type to Zip Code, to preserve the five-digit format of zip codes that start with zero.
